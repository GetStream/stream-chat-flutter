## Upcoming Beta

🛑️ Breaking

- `PollMessage` widget has been removed and replaced with `PollAttachment` for better integration
  with the attachment system. Polls can now be customized through `PollAttachmentBuilder` or by
  creating custom poll attachment widgets via the attachment builder system.

## 10.0.0-beta.2

- Included the changes from version [`9.13.0`](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_chat_flutter/changelog).

## 9.13.0

🐞 Fixed

- Fixed `FloatingDateDivider` not showing the correct date when the latest message was too big and
  exceeded the viewport main axis size.
- Fixed `ScrollToBottom` button always showing when the latest message was too big and exceeded the
  viewport main axis size.

## 10.0.0-beta.1

🛑️ Breaking

- `StreamReactionPicker` now requires reactions to be explicitly handled via `onReactionPicked`. *(Automatic handling is no longer supported.)*
- `StreamMessageAction` is now generic `(StreamMessageAction<T>)`, enhancing type safety. Individual onTap callbacks have been removed; actions are now handled centrally by widgets like `StreamMessageWidget.onCustomActionTap` or modals using action types.
- `StreamMessageReactionsModal` no longer requires the `messageTheme` parameter. The theme now automatically derives from the `reverse` property.
- `StreamMessageWidget` no longer requires the `showReactionTail` parameter. The reaction picker tail is now always shown when the reaction picker is visible.

For more details, please refer to the [migration guide](../../migrations/v10-migration.md).

✅ Added

- Added new `StreamMessageActionsBuilder` which provides a list of actions to be displayed in the message actions modal.
- Added new `StreamMessageActionConfirmationModal` for confirming destructive actions like delete or flag.
- Added new `StreamMessageModal` and `showStreamMessageModal` for consistent message-related modals with improved transitions and backdrop effects.

    ),
  );
  ```

- Added `reactionPickerBuilder` to `StreamMessageActionsModal`, `StreamMessageReactionsModal`, and `StreamMessageWidget` to enable custom reaction picker widgets.
- Added `StreamReactionIcon.defaultReactions` providing a predefined list of common reaction icons.

- Removed the additional `Navigator` in `StreamChat` widget. It was added to make the app have
  the `StreamChat` widget as ancestor in every route. Now the recommended way to add `StreamChat` to
  your app is using the `builder` property of your `MaterialApp` widget. Otherwise you can use it in
  the usual way, but you need to add a `StreamChat` widget to every route of your app.
  Read [this issue](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/issues/47) for more
  information.

```dart
  @override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return MaterialApp(
    theme: ThemeData.light(),

    themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
    builder: (context, widget) {
      return StreamChat(
        child: widget,
        client: client,
      );
    },

  );
