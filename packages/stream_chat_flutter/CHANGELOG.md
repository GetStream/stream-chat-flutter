## 10.0.0

🛑️ Breaking

- Replaced `ArgumentError` with typed errors in `StreamAttachmentPickerController`:
  `AttachmentTooLargeError` (file size exceeds limit) and `AttachmentLimitReachedError`
  (attachment count exceeds limit). [[#2476]](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/issues/2476)
- `onAttachmentTap` callback signature changed to include `BuildContext` as first parameter and
  returns `FutureOr<bool>` to indicate if handled.
- `ReactionPickerIconList` constructor changed: removed `message` parameter, changed `reactionIcons`
  type to `List<ReactionPickerIcon>`, renamed `onReactionPicked` to `onIconPicked`.
- `onCustomAttachmentPickerResult` has been removed. Use `onAttachmentPickerResult` which returns `FutureOr<bool>` to indicate if the result was handled.
- `customAttachmentPickerOptions` has been removed. Use `attachmentPickerOptionsBuilder` to modify, reorder, or extend default options.
- `StreamReactionPicker` now requires reactions to be explicitly handled via `onReactionPicked`. *(Automatic handling is no longer supported.)*
- `StreamMessageAction` is now generic `(StreamMessageAction<T>)`, enhancing type safety. Individual onTap callbacks have been removed; actions are now handled centrally by widgets like `StreamMessageWidget.onCustomActionTap` or modals using action types.
- `StreamMessageReactionsModal` no longer requires the `messageTheme` parameter. The theme now automatically derives from the `reverse` property.
- `StreamMessageWidget` no longer requires the `showReactionTail` parameter. The reaction picker tail is now always shown when the reaction picker is visible.
- `AttachmentPickerType` enum has been replaced with a sealed class to support extensible custom types like contact and location pickers. Use built-in types like `AttachmentPickerType.images` or define your own via `CustomAttachmentPickerType`.
- `StreamAttachmentPickerOption` has been replaced with two sealed classes to support layout-specific picker options: `SystemAttachmentPickerOption` for system pickers (e.g. camera, files) and `TabbedAttachmentPickerOption` for tabbed pickers (e.g. gallery, polls, location).
- `showStreamAttachmentPickerModalBottomSheet` now returns a `StreamAttachmentPickerResult` instead of `AttachmentPickerValue` for improved type safety and clearer intent handling.
- `StreamMobileAttachmentPickerBottomSheet` has been renamed to `StreamTabbedAttachmentPickerBottomSheet`, and `StreamWebOrDesktopAttachmentPickerBottomSheet` has been renamed to `StreamSystemAttachmentPickerBottomSheet` to better reflect their respective layouts.
- `PollMessage` widget has been removed and replaced with `PollAttachment` for better integration with the attachment system. Polls can now be customized through `PollAttachmentBuilder` or by creating custom poll attachment widgets via the attachment builder system.
- **Deprecated API Cleanup**: Removed all deprecated classes, methods, and properties for the v10 major release:
  - **Removed Classes**: `DmCheckbox` (use `DmCheckboxListTile`), `StreamIconThemeSvgIcon` (use `StreamSvgIcon`), `StreamVoiceRecordingThemeData` (use `StreamVoiceRecordingAttachmentThemeData`), `StreamVoiceRecordingLoading`, `StreamVoiceRecordingSlider` (use `StreamAudioWaveformSlider`), `StreamVoiceRecordingPlayer` (use `StreamVoiceRecordingAttachment`), `StreamVoiceRecordingListPlayer` (use `StreamVoiceRecordingAttachmentPlaylist`)
  - **Removed Properties**: `reactionIcons` and `voiceRecordingTheme` from `StreamChatTheme`, `isThreadConversation` from `FloatingDateDivider`, `idleSendButton` and `activeSendButton` from `StreamMessageInput`, `isCommandEnabled` and `isEditEnabled` from `StreamMessageSendButton`, `assetName`, `width`, and `height` from `StreamSvgIcon`
  - **Removed Constructor Parameters**: `useNativeAttachmentPickerOnMobile` from various components, `allowCompression` from `StreamAttachmentHandler.pickFile()` and `StreamFilePicker` (use `compressionQuality` instead), `cid` from `StreamUnreadIndicator` constructor
  - **Removed Methods**: `lastUnreadMessage()` from message list extensions (use `StreamChannel.getFirstUnreadMessage`), `loadBuffer()` and `_loadAsync()` from `StreamVideoThumbnailImage`
  - **StreamSvgIcon Refactoring**: Removed 80+ deprecated factory constructors. Use `StreamSvgIcon(icon: StreamSvgIcons.iconName)` instead of factory constructors like `StreamSvgIcon.add()`

- Removed the additional `Navigator` in `StreamChat` widget. It was added to make the app have
  the `StreamChat` widget as ancestor in every route. Now the recommended way to add `StreamChat` to
  your app is using the `builder` property of your `MaterialApp` widget. Otherwise you can use it in
  the usual way, but you need to add a `StreamChat` widget to every route of your app.
  Read [this issue](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/issues/47) for more
  information.

```dart
  @override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return MaterialApp(
    theme: ThemeData.light(),
    darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
    themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
    builder: (context, widget) {
      return StreamChat(
        child: widget,
        client: client,
      );
    },
    home: ChannelListPage(),
  );
}
