/// Shows a modal material design bottom sheet.
///
/// A modal bottom sheet is an alternative to a menu or a dialog and prevents
/// the user from interacting with the rest of the app.
///
/// A closely related widget is a persistent bottom sheet, which shows
/// information that supplements the primary content of the app without
/// preventing the use from interacting with the app. Persistent bottom sheets
/// can be created and displayed with the [showBottomSheet] function or the
/// [ScaffoldState.showBottomSheet] method.
///
/// The `context` argument is used to look up the [Navigator] and [Theme] for
/// the bottom sheet. It is only used when the method is called. Its
/// corresponding widget can be safely removed from the tree before the bottom
/// sheet is closed.
///
/// The `isScrollControlled` parameter specifies whether this is a route for
/// a bottom sheet that will utilize [DraggableScrollableSheet]. If you wish
/// to have a bottom sheet that has a scrollable child such as a [ListView] or
/// a [GridView] and have the bottom sheet be draggable, you should set this
/// parameter to true.
///
/// The `useRootNavigator` parameter ensures that the root navigator is used to
/// display the [BottomSheet] when set to `true`. This is useful in the case
/// that a modal [BottomSheet] needs to be displayed above all other content
/// but the caller is inside another [Navigator].
///
/// The [isDismissible] parameter specifies whether the bottom sheet will be
/// dismissed when user taps on the scrim.
///
/// The [enableDrag] parameter specifies whether the bottom sheet can be
/// dragged up and down and dismissed by swiping downwards.
///
/// The optional [backgroundColor], [elevation], [shape], [clipBehavior],
/// [constraints] and [transitionAnimationController]
/// parameters can be passed in to customize the appearance and behavior of
/// modal bottom sheets (see the documentation for these on [BottomSheet]
/// for more details).
///
/// The [transitionAnimationController] controls the bottom sheet's entrance and
/// exit animations if provided.
///
/// The optional `routeSettings` parameter sets the [RouteSettings]
/// of the modal bottom sheet sheet.
/// This is particularly useful in the case that a user wants to observe
/// [PopupRoute]s within a [NavigatorObserver].
///
/// Returns a `Future` that resolves to the value (if any) that was passed to
/// [Navigator.pop] when the modal bottom sheet was closed.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [BottomSheet], which becomes the parent of the widget returned by the
///    function passed as the `builder` argument to [showModalBottomSheet].
///  * [showBottomSheet] and [ScaffoldState.showBottomSheet], for showing
///    non-modal bottom sheets.
///  * [DraggableScrollableSheet], which allows you to create a bottom sheet
///    that grows and then becomes scrollable once it reaches its maximum size.
