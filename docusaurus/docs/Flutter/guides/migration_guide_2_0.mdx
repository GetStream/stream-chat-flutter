A Migration Guide For Switching To v2.0 Of The Flutter SDK

### Overview

v2.0 of the Stream Chat Flutter SDK brings along several changes - primarily making the SDK null-safe.
Null safety allows your apps to run faster, with fewer errors, and with less code.

Check [this link](https://flutter.dev/docs/null-safety) for more about Null Safety in Flutter.

This guide is intended to enumerate and better explain the changes in the SDK.

The changes will be listed by package and a concise changelog will be followed by more info.

### Changelog of `stream_chat_flutter`

#### 🛑️ Breaking Changes from 1.5.4

* Migrate this package to null safety

Minor fixes and improvements

### Migrating to 2.0 for `stream_chat_flutter`

:::note
If you are migrating your full Flutter project to null-safety, first make sure you follow the
instructions from the [official Null Safety migration guide](https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide).
:::

To migrate to v2.0 for `stream_chat_flutter`, first change the version of the package to the latest
null-safe version.

```yaml
dependencies:
  stream_chat_flutter: ^2.0.0
```

Upon doing this, all breaking changes from the package will take immediate effect. Here are steps to
remedy the issue:

1) Replace the offending class names with the revised class names

    * ChannelImage -> ChannelAvatar
    * ImageHeader -> GalleryHeader
    * ImageFooter -> GalleryFooter

2) The new version comes with revised color names since the previous names do not suit light/dark mode
nomenclature. Make sure any old colors used from theme are changed over to the new theme color names:

    * ColorTheme.black -> ColorTheme.textHighEmphasis
    * ColorTheme.grey -> ColorTheme.textLowEmphasis
    * ColorTheme.greyGainsboro -> ColorTheme.disabled
    * ColorTheme.greyWhisper -> ColorTheme.borders
    * ColorTheme.whiteSmoke -> ColorTheme.inputBg
    * ColorTheme.whiteSnow -> ColorTheme.appBg
    * ColorTheme.white -> ColorTheme.barsBg
    * ColorTheme.blueAlice -> ColorTheme.linkBg
    * ColorTheme.accentBlue -> ColorTheme.accentPrimary
    * ColorTheme.accentRed -> ColorTheme.accentError
    * ColorTheme.accentGreen -> ColorTheme.accentInfo

3) We decided to make messages easier to customize and now supply the default implementation of the
messages in the builder - so you can now customize a single parameter without having to redo the
entire implementation. Please reform your builders to take into account the new format:

```
typedef MessageBuilder = Widget Function(
    BuildContext,
    MessageDetails,
    List<Message>,
    MessageWidget defaultMessageWidget,
    );
```

Use `defaultMessageWidget.copyWith()` to edit any properties to make it much simpler to tweak the
default implementation.

### Changelog of `stream_chat_flutter_core`

#### 🛑️ Breaking Changes from 1.5.3

* Migrate this package to null safety
* channelsBloc.queryChannels(), ChannelListCore options param/property is removed in favor of individual params/properties
    * options.state -> bool state
    * options.watch -> bool watch
    * options.presence -> bool presence
* usersBloc.queryUsers(), UserListCore options param/property is removed in favor of individual params/properties
    * options.presence -> bool presence

#### ✅ Added

* Monitor connection using connectivity_plus package

#### 🐞 Fixed

* Minor fixes
* Performance improvements

### Migrating to 2.0 for `stream_chat_flutter_core`

If you are migrating your full Flutter project to null-safety, first make sure you follow the
instructions from the [official Null Safety migration guide](https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide).
:::

To migrate to v2.0 for `stream_chat_flutter_core`, first change the version of the package to the latest
null-safe version.

```yaml
dependencies:
  stream_chat_flutter_core: ^2.0.0
```

Upon doing this, all breaking changes from the package will take immediate effect. Here are steps to
remedy the issue:

:::note
The major changes in `stream_chat_flutter_core` consist of changing over from a map full of options
to a more type safe and sound approach by changing over to explicit parameters.
:::

1) Change over Core widget implementations by using the explicit parameters instead of the options map.
Use these explicit parameters in the widget constructor instead of the option keys:

    * options.state -> bool state
    * options.watch -> bool watch
    * options.presence -> bool presence

2) Change over query calls in the BLoCs in the same way (change from options map to explicit parameters
in the constructor)

### Changelog of `stream_chat`

#### 🛑️ Breaking Changes from 1.5.3

* Migrate this package to null safety
* ConnectUserWithProvider now requires tokenProvider as a required param. (Removed from the constructor)
* client.disconnect() is now divided into two different functions
    * client.closeConnection() -> for closing user websocket connection.
    * client.disconnectUser() -> for disconnecting user and resetting client state.
* client.devToken() now returns a Token model instead of String.
* ApiError is removed in favor of StreamChatError
    * StreamChatError -> parent type for all the stream errors.
    * StreamWebSocketError -> for user websocket related errors.
    * StreamChatNetworkError -> for network related errors.
* client.queryChannels(), channel.query() options param is removed in favor of individual params
    * option.state -> bool state
    * option.watch -> bool watch
    * option.presence -> bool presence
* client.queryUsers() options param is removed in favor of individual params
    * option.presence -> bool presence
* Added typed filters

#### 🐞 Fixed

* #369: Client does not return without internet connection
* several minor fixes
* performance improvements

#### ✅ Added

* New Location enum is introduced for easily changing the client location/baseUrl.
* New client.openConnection() and client.closeConnection() is introduced to connect/disconnect user ws connection.
* New client.partialUpdateMessage and channel.partialUpdateMessage methods
* connectWebSocket parameter in connect user calls to use the client in "connection-less" mode.

#### 🔄 Changed

* baseURL is now deprecated in favor of using Location to change data location.

### Migrating to 2.0 for `stream_chat`

If you are migrating your full Flutter project to null-safety, first make sure you follow the
instructions from the [official Null Safety migration guide](https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide).
:::

To migrate to v2.0 for `stream_chat`, first change the version of the package to the latest
null-safe version.

```yaml
dependencies:
  stream_chat: ^2.0.0
```

Upon doing this, all breaking changes from the package will take immediate effect. Here are steps to
remedy the issue:

1) Change over the constructor of `connectUserWithProvider()` to the new format.

2) We added more nuance to the `disconnectUser` by adding two new methods - one to close the connection
and the other to disconnect the user. This allows more fine-grained control for diconnection.

    * client.closeConnection() -> for closing user websocket connection.
    * client.disconnectUser() -> for disconnecting user and resetting client state.

3) We refactored how we handle errors - new error types are now introduced instead of ApiError.

    * StreamChatError -> parent type for all the stream errors.
    * StreamWebSocketError -> for user websocket related errors.
    * StreamChatNetworkError -> for network related errors.

4) We changed over from a map full of options to a more type safe and sound approach by changing over to explicit parameters.

Use these explicit parameters in the query parameters instead of the option keys:

* client.queryChannels(), channel.query() options param is removed in favor of individual params
    * option.state -> bool state
    * option.watch -> bool watch
    * option.presence -> bool presence
* client.queryUsers() options param is removed in favor of individual params
    * option.presence -> bool presence

5) We added type safe filters to make filtering in the app easier. Change over the filters to the
new implementation.

As an example, in the old app this filter:

```dart
    filter: {
      'members': {
        '\$in': [StreamChat.of(context).user.id],
      }
    },
```

Would turn into:

```dart
    filter: Filter.in_('members', [StreamChat.of(context).user.id])
```
