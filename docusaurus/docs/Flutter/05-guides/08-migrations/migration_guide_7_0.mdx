This guide enumerates and better explains the SDK changes introduced in v7.

If you find any bugs or have any questions, please file an [issue on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter/issues). We want to support you as much as we can with this migration.

Code examples:

- See our [Stream Chat Flutter tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/flutter/tutorial/) for an up-to-date guide using the latest Stream Chat version.
- See the [Stream Flutter Samples repository](https://github.com/GetStream/flutter-samples) with our full fledged messaging [sample application](https://github.com/GetStream/flutter-samples/tree/main/packages/stream_chat_v1).

Our documentation has also been updated to support v7, so all guides and examples will have updated code.

### Dependencies

To migrate to v7.0.0, update your `pubspec.yaml` with the correct Stream chat package you're using:

```yaml
dependencies:
	stream_chat_flutter: ^7.0.0 # full UI, core and client packages
	stream_chat: ^7.0.0 # client package
```

## What's New?

We improved the overall user experience of the Stream Chat Flutter SDK and added new features to make it easier to customize the SDK to your needs.

We've also fixed several bugs and improved the overall stability of the SDK.

Added support for `StreamMessageInput.contentInsertionConfiguration` to specify the content insertion configuration.

  ```dart
  StreamMessageInput(
    ...,
    contentInsertionConfiguration: ContentInsertionConfiguration(
      onContentInserted: (content) {
        // Do something with the content.
        controller.addAttachment(...);
      },
    ),
  )
  ```
## Breaking changes

The following components have been removed in v7.0.0:

- `ChatPersistenceClient.getChannelStates.sort` has been removed in favor of `ChatPersistenceClient.getChannelStates.channelStateSort`.
```dart
/// BEFORE
chatPersistenceClient.getChannelStates(
  ...
  sort: [SortOption('last_message_at')],
)

/// AFTER

  ...
  channelStateSort: [SortOption('last_message_at')],

MessageListView(
  onMessageSwiped: (Message message) => // handle swipe,
  ...
)

/// AFTER
MessageListView(
  messageBuilder: (BuildContext context, Message message) =>
    Swipeable(
      key: ValueKey(message.id),
      onSwiped: (_) => // handle swipe,
      child: StreamMessageWidget(
        message: message,
        ...
      ),
    ),
)
```
