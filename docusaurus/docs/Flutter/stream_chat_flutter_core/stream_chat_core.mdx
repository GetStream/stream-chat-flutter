`StreamChatCore` is a version of `StreamChat` found in stream_chat_flutter that is decoupled from 
theme and initialisations.

`StreamChatCore` is used to provide information about the chat client to the widget tree.
This Widget is used to react to life cycle changes and system updates.
When the app goes into the background, the websocket connection is kept
alive for two minutes before being terminated.

Like the StreamChat widget in the higher level UI package, the StreamChatCore widget should
be on the top level before using any Stream functionality:

```dart
return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stream Chat Core Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
      builder: (context, child) => StreamChatCore(
        client: client,
        child: child!,
      ),
    );
```
