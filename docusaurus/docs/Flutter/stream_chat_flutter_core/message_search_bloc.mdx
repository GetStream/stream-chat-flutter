A Widget Used To Manage A List Of Messages With Pagination.

### Background

Most widgets in the Core SDK are focused on fetching a particular type of object from Stream Chat - channels,
messages, users etc. The BLoC widgets bundle up the base functions used to fetch data as well as the current
data fetched by the respective functions. Furthermore, the Core widgets use this BLoC to fetch new or
existing data and build UI based on it.

All Core and UI widgets which focus on fetching a list of objects need to have their respective functions
above them in the widget tree. The MessageSearchListCore and MessageSearchListView require the
MessageSearchListCore above them in the widget hierarchy without which they will fail.

### Understanding The Widget

This class can be used to load messages, perform queries, etc.

`MessageSearchBloc` can be accessed at anytime by using the static `.of` method
using Flutter's BuildContext.

```dart
var _searchBloc = MessageSearchBloc.of(context);
```

The `MessageSearchBloc` widget encapsulates common functionality related to searching for messages
across channels and also supplies them down the widget tree.

Here is a basic implementation of `ChannelsBloc`:

```dart
MessageSearchBloc(
    child: // Further Widget Tree
),
```
