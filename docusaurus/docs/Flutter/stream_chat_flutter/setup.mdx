Understanding Setup For `stream_chat_flutter`

### Add pub.dev dependency

First, you need to add the `stream_chat_flutter` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`.

You can either run this command:

```shell
flutter pub add stream_chat_flutter
```

OR

Add this line in the dependencies section of your pubspec.yaml after substituting latest version:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stream_chat_flutter: ^latest_version
```

You can find the package details on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_chat_flutter).

### Details On Platform Support

`stream_chat_flutter` was originally created for Android and iOS mobile platforms. As Flutter matured,
support for additional platforms was added and the package now has experimental support for web and desktop as
[detailed here](https://getstream.io/blog/announcing-experimental-multi-platform-support-for-the-stream-flutter-sdk/).

However, platforms other than mobile may have additional constraints due to not supporting all plugins,
which will be addressed by the respective plugin creators over time.

### Setup: iOS

The library uses [flutter file picker plugin](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker) to pick files from the os.
Follow [this wiki](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/wiki/Setup#ios) to fulfill iOS requirements.

We also use [video_player](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player) to reproduce videos.
Follow [this guide](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player#installation) to fulfill the requirements.

To pick images from the camera, we use the [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) plugin.
