A Widget For Displaying Message Searches

### Background

The UI SDK of Stream Chat supplies a `MessageSearchListView` class that builds a list of channels fetching
according to the filters and sort order given. However, in some cases, implementing novel UI is necessary
that cannot be done using the customization approaches given in the widget.

To do this, we extracted the logic required for fetching channels into a 'Core' widget - a widget that
fetches channels in the expected way via the usual parameters but does not supply any UI and instead
exposes builders to build the UI in situations such as loading, empty data, errors, and on data received.

### Basic Example

`MessageSearchListCore` is a simplified class that allows searching for
 messages across channels while exposing UI builders.
 A `MessageSearchListController` is used to load and paginate data.

```dart
class MessageSearchPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: MessageSearchListCore(
        messageQuery: _messageFilter,
        filters: _channelsFilter,
        limit: 20,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Make sure to have a `MessageSearchBloc` ancestor in order to provide the
information about the messages.
