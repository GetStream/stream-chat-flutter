A Widget For Displaying A List Of Channels

Find the pub.dev documentation [here](https://pub.dev/documentation/stream_chat_flutter/latest/stream_chat_flutter/StreamChannelListView-class.html)

### Background

Channels are fundamental elements of Stream Chat and constitute shared spaces which allow users to
message each other.

1:1 conversations and groups are both examples of channels, albeit with some (distinct/non-distinct)
differences. Displaying the list of channels that a user is a part of is a pattern present in most messaging apps.

The `StreamChannelListView` widget allows displaying a list of channels to a user. By default, this is NOT
ONLY the channels that the user is a part of. This section goes into setting up and using a `StreamChannelListView`
widget.

:::note
Make sure to check the [StreamChannelListController](../04-stream_chat_flutter_core/stream_channel_list_controller.mdx) documentation for more information on how to use the controller to manipulate the `StreamChannelListView`.

### Basic Example

Here is a basic example of the `StreamChannelListView` widget. It consists of the main widget itself, a `StreamChannelListController` to control the list of channels and a callback to handle the tap of a channel.

```dart
class ChannelListPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const ChannelListPage({
    super.key,
    required this.client,
  });

  final StreamChatClient client;

  @override
  State<ChannelListPage> createState() => _ChannelListPageState();
}

class _ChannelListPageState extends State<ChannelListPage> {
  late final _controller = StreamChannelListController(
    client: widget.client,
    filter: Filter.in_(
      'members',
      [StreamChat.of(context).currentUser!.id],
    ),
    channelStateSort: const [SortOption('last_message_at')],
  );

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
        body: RefreshIndicator(
          onRefresh: _controller.refresh,
          child: StreamChannelListView(
            controller: _controller,
            onChannelTap: (channel) => Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(
                builder: (_) => StreamChannel(
                  channel: channel,
                  child: const ChannelPage(),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      );
}
```

This example by default displays the channels that a user is a part of. Now let's look at customizing
the widget.

### Customizing the Channel Preview

A common aspect of the widget needed to be tweaked according to each app is the Channel Preview (the
Channel tile in the list). To do this, we use the `itemBuilder` parameter like this:

```dart
StreamChannelListView(
  ...
  itemBuilder: (context, channels, index, defaultTile) {
    return ListTile(
      tileColor: Colors.amberAccent,
      title: Center(
        child: StreamChannelName(channel: channels[index]),
      ),
    );
  },
),
```

Which gives you a new Channel preview in the list:
