Understanding The UI Package Of The Flutter SDK

### What function does `stream_chat_flutter` serve?

The UI SDK (`stream_chat_flutter`) contains official Flutter components for Stream Chat, a service for building chat applications.

While the Stream Chat service provides the backend for messaging and the LLC provides an easy way to
use it in your Flutter apps, we wanted to make sure that adding Chat functionality to your app was as quick as possible.

The UI package is built on top of the low-level client and the core package and allows you to build a
full fledged app with either the inbuilt components, modify existing components, or easily add widgets
of your own to match your app's style better.
