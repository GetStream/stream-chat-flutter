A Widget For Building A Paginated List

Find the pub.dev documentation [here](https://pub.dev/documentation/stream_chat_flutter_core/latest/stream_chat_flutter_core/LazyLoadScrollView-class.html)

### Background

The `LazyLoadScrollView` is a widget that helps you build a paginated list.
It provides callbacks to notify you when the list has been scrolled to the bottom and when the list has been scrolled to the top and other necessary callbacks.

#### Callbacks

* onStartOfPage: called when the list has been scrolled to the top of the page.

* onEndOfPage: called when the list has been scrolled to the bottom of the page.

* onPageScrollStart: called when the scroll of the list starts.

* onPageScrollEnd: called when the scroll of the list ends.

* onInBetweenOfPage: called when the list is not either at the top nor at the bottom of the page.

### Basic Example

Building a paginated list is a very common task. Here is an example of how to use the `LazyLoadScrollView` to build a simple list with pagination.

```dart
LazyLoadScrollView(
  onEndOfPage: _paginateData,
  /// The child could be any widget which dispatches [ScrollNotification]s.
  /// For example [ListView], [GridView] or [CustomScrollView].
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemBuilder: (context, index) => _buildListTile,
  ),
)
```
