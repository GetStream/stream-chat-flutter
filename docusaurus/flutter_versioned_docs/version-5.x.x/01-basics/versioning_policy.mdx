All of the Stream Chat packages follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

That means that with a version number x.y.z (major.minor.patch):
- When releasing bug fixes (backwards compatible), we make a patch release by changing the z number (ex: 3.6.2 to 3.6.3). A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.
- When releasing new features or non-critical fixes, we make a minor release by changing the y number (ex: 3.6.2 to 3.7.0).
- When releasing breaking changes (backward incompatible), we make a major release by changing the x number (ex: 3.6.2 to 4.0.0).

See the [semantic versioning](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning#semantic-versions) section from the Dart docs for more information.

This versioning policy does not apply to prerelease packages (below major version of 1). See this
[StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66201337/how-do-dart-package-versions-work-how-should-i-version-my-flutter-plugins)
for more information on Dart package versioning.

Whenever possible, we will add deprecation warnings in preparation for future breaking changes.
