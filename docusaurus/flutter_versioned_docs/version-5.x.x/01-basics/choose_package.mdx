Choosing The Right Flutter Package

### Why the SDK is split into different packages

Different applications need different levels of customization and integration with the Stream Chat SDK.
To do this, the Flutter SDK is split into three different packages which build upon the last and give
varying levels of control to the developer. The higher level packages offer better compatibility out of the
box while the lower level SDKs offer fine grained control. There is also a separate package for persistence
which allows you persist data locally which works with all packages.

### How do I choose?

#### The case for `stream_chat_flutter`

For the quickest way to integrate Stream Chat with your app, the UI SDK (`stream_chat_flutter`) is the
way to go. `stream_chat_flutter` contains prebuilt components that manage most operations like data
fetching, pagination, sending a message, and more. This ensures you have a nearly out-of-the-box
experience adding chat to your applications. It is also possible to use this in conjunction with
lower level operations of the SDK to get the best of both worlds.

:::note
The package allows customization of components to a large extent making it easy to tweak the theme
to match your app colors and such. If you require any additional feature or customization, feel free
to request this through our support channels.

<b>Summary:</b>

For the quickest and easiest way to add Chat to your app with prebuilt UI components, use `stream_chat_flutter`


#### The case for `stream_chat_flutter_core`

If your application involves UI that does not fit in with the `stream_chat_flutter` components, `stream_chat_flutter_core`
strips away the UI associated with the components and provides the data fetching and manipulation
capabilities while supplying builders for UI. This allows you to implement your own UI and themes
completely independently while not worrying about writing functions for data and pagination.

<b>Summary:</b>

For implementing your own custom UI while not having to worry about lower level API calls, use `stream_chat_flutter_core`.

#### The case for `stream_chat`

The `stream_chat` package is the Low-level Client (LLC) of Stream Chat in Flutter. This package wraps
the underlying functionality of Stream Chat and allows the most customization in terms of UI, data,
and architecture.

<b>Summary:</b>

For the most control over the SDK and dealing with low level calls to the API, use `stream_chat`.
